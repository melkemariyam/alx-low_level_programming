Synopsis

This repository holds some projects I worked on for Holberton School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.
Concepts to be learned in this repository:

    What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
    What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
    What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

Description of what each file shows:

    a function that fills memory with a constant byte (memset)
    a function that copies memory area (memcpy)
    a function that locates a character in a string (strchr)
    a function that gets the length of a prefix substring (strspn)
    a function that searches and returns a pointer to a byte matched in a string (strpbrk)
    a function that locates a substring (strstr)
    a function that prints the chessboard
    a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
    a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char
    a file that contains the password for the [crackme2 executable] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x06.c)
        file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
        ltrace, ldd, gdb and objdump can help
        install the openssl library to run the crackme2 program: sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
